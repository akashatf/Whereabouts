    <h2>Welcome to Whereabouts!</h2>
    <h2>Our Favorite Places!</h2>

    Since we're all from different areas around the Bay Area, we decided to give you guys a list of our favorite spots to hang out!
    <h2>Akasha</h2>
    I'm more so of a homebody, but when I do go out, I enjoy going to Miss Nail (Salon) in Hayward and shopping at the Stanford Shopping Center. I love eating at Whole Foods because they have such a great spread of foods.
    <h2>Katie</h2>
    When I'm bored, I tend to reach out to friends and we stick to going to a lot of the same spots in San Jose. My favorite places to go in San Jose are Downtown Willow Glen, Pho Wagon, Boba Bar, Crema, Hubs, Ryland Park, and Willow Glen Creamery
    <h2>Muthu</h2>
    My favorite places are Sue's Gallery Cafe and Santana Row. I always go to Sue's to do work, and I order lots of iced matcha lattes! Santana Row is a great place to grab a bite to eat with friends. My favorite restaurant there is Pizza Antica.
